# arc-updater

Simple executable to update arcdps from [https://www.deltaconnected/arcdps/"](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/)

Only requirement is that you place it in a folder inside of your ../Guild Wars 2/ directory. Such as ../Guild Wars 2/arc-updater/

Up to you how you want to implement it. All it does is fetch the files and verify the checksums.

Pls nerf firebrand
